Proposal:
**Idea 1:**
We plan to create a web application to enhance medication use experience. Through the application users will be able to speed up picking up their medicine. In addition, patients will have a personalized experience of the process of taking medicines including pill refill reminders. The application will feature a database on pill information (ie: correct dose amount, side effects). Also there will be reminders to take medicine with images and easily readable pill consumption instructions. Another feature is heart rate detection to detect if the medicine is causing any side effects, but also capable of detecting a healthy heart rate recovery. It would store this information in a personalized account that the user would be able to access later to compare the effects of the drug to previous prescriptions using the web app. One other feature is price comparison for prescription and non-branded medication. The target audiences include older individuals and parents. This is because parents do not have all the time in the world with work and kids to devote multiple trips to the pharmacy to ask for a prescription and then having to wait for it to be filled. Also, older people tend to have more trouble remembering what to take as their need for medicines increases with age. Parents can also use this application to keep track of their children’s medicine. In addition, these groups of audiences are suitable because none of our team members is old or a parent. Possible sources of dataset could include the drug data from the website DrugBank which contains information on drugs and drug targets. Possible APIs include GoodRx, Pharmacy prescription API  - Walgreen’s API, and Heart rate / HealthKit. The GoodRx and Pharmacy prescription API provides methods for comparing prescription drug prices, finding alternative drugs, and refilling prescriptions at certain pharmacies. The omron wellness partner API allows for measuring blood pressure, and we would be able to use that data to compare the effects of different prescriptions to test which prescription is the best match for the taker. In addition, we may utilize Google Maps api to provide users with a map of store locations.
