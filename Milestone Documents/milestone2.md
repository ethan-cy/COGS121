Ideas:
We have similar ideas from milestone one. And our ideas right now are only a little bit different from milestone one. The target users of the app is different. Now, our drug information and prescription renewal feature focus on the elders population. We keep the heart rate feature which keeps track of the user's heart rate and the account settings for changing username and password which can save the heart rate information, prescription, and drug information searches.

Screenshots and Paper Prototypes:
For the Home Page, we keep the design of four boxes in a grid for each feature rather having a bar on the bottom of the app. Instead of having side bar or bar menus, we use the four grids because there are only few functions right now and this design simplifies the app and users can easily understand what tasks they can do with each function. For drug information, there is a search bar and the information is displayed below it instead of creating a new page which may takes up more time and space.
