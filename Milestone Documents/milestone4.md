For this milestone, we changed the old red background color to a gradient of light blue and light green. The red seemed too bright on users and we changed it to something lighter and gives a more comfortable feeling.

The prescription feature requires the user to input their prescription number (specifically rx prescriptions). Then the userâ€™s number will be sent as a post request to the Walgreens api, which then opens the appropriate URL to complete their refill. After completion users are prompted to refill another or cancel.
